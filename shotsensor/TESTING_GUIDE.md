# 🧪 Testing Guide - Phase 2 MVP

## 🎉 Phase 2 Complete!

You now have a working end-to-end ball detection system. Here's how to test it before Thursday.

---

## 🖥️ Desktop Testing (Do This Now!)

### 1. Start the Dev Server

```bash
cd shotsensor
npm run dev
```

Open: `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Test the Full Flow

**Step-by-step test:**

1. **Game Mode Selection**
   - [ ] Click "Pool (8-Ball)"
   - [ ] UI looks good
   - [ ] Button animations work

2. **Player Type Selection**
   - [ ] Click "Stripes" or "Solids"
   - [ ] Visual feedback works
   - [ ] Click "Continue to Camera"

3. **Image Upload**
   - [ ] Click "Upload Photo Instead"
   - [ ] Select a pool table image from your computer
   - [ ] Image loads successfully

4. **Detection Processing**
   - [ ] Progress circle shows (0% → 100%)
   - [ ] Stage indicators update:
     - "Loading image"
     - "Preprocessing"
     - "Detecting circles"
     - "Classifying colors"
     - "Finalizing results"
   - [ ] Takes 2-10 seconds depending on image

5. **Results Display**
   - [ ] Shows "Detection Complete!"
   - [ ] Displays number of balls found
   - [ ] Shows detected image
   - [ ] Ball list with colors and confidence scores
   - [ ] Detection summary shows ball type breakdown
   - [ ] "Analyze Another Table" button works
   - [ ] "Start Over" button works

### 3. Get Test Images

Since you don't have images yet, here are quick ways to get them:

**Option A: Google Images**
```
Search: "pool table overhead view"
Search: "snooker table top down"
Filter: Large size
Download: 2-3 images
```

**Option B: Free Stock Photos**
- Unsplash.com: Search "pool table"
- Pexels.com: Search "billiards"
- Download high-res images

**Option C: Screenshot**
- Find YouTube videos of pool/snooker
- Pause at good overhead angle
- Take screenshot
- Save as JPG

**What makes a good test image:**
- ✅ Overhead view (looking straight down)
- ✅ Good lighting (no heavy shadows)
- ✅ Multiple balls visible
- ✅ Table fills most of frame
- ✅ High resolution (at least 1280x720)

### 4. Test Different Scenarios

Once you have images, test:

- [ ] **Simple setup** (3-5 balls) - Should detect all
- [ ] **Full table** (15 balls) - See how many it finds
- [ ] **Good lighting** - Should have high confidence (70%+)
- [ ] **Poor lighting** - Will have lower confidence
- [ ] **Different angles** - Overhead works best

## 📱 Mobile Testing (Thursday Evening)

### Before You Go to the Pool Hall:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (so you can access on phone)
   ```bash
   # Push to GitHub (already done)
   # Go to vercel.com
   # Import project
   # Deploy!
   ```

2. **Get your Vercel URL** (e.g., `https://shotsensor-xyz.vercel.app`)

3. **Test on your phone at home first:**
   - Open URL on phone
   - Grant camera permission
   - Take a test photo of any round objects
   - Verify detection works

### At the Pool Hall:

**What to test:**

1. **Camera Access**
   - [ ] Camera opens on phone
   - [ ] Can switch front/back camera (if needed)
   - [ ] Preview shows clearly
   - [ ] Can capture photo

2. **Different Lighting**
   - [ ] Bright overhead lights
   - [ ] Side lighting
   - [ ] Shadow conditions
   - [ ] Compare detection accuracy

3. **Different Angles**
   - [ ] Straight overhead (best)
   - [ ] Slight angle
   - [ ] From end of table
   - [ ] Note which works best

4. **Different Game States**
   - [ ] Start of game (all balls racked)
   - [ ] Mid-game (scattered)
   - [ ] Few balls left
   - [ ] Tricky positions

**Tips for best results:**
- Stand directly above table if possible
- Hold phone steady (use both hands)
- Wait for good lighting moment
- Capture entire table in frame
- Avoid glare on balls
- Multiple attempts if needed

## 🐛 Expected Issues & Solutions

### Issue: No balls detected
**Possible causes:**
- Image too blurry
- Lighting too dark
- No round objects in image
- Angle too steep

**Solutions:**
- Use clearer image
- Better lighting
- Overhead view
- Check image actually has balls

### Issue: Wrong ball types detected
**Possible causes:**
- Lighting affects colors
- Stripe detection not perfect
- Similar colored balls

**Solutions:**
- This is expected in MVP!
- Phase 3 will add manual correction
- Note which colors work best
- Test different lighting

### Issue: Detection too slow
**Possible causes:**
- Very large image (4K+)
- Many balls to process
- Older phone/computer

**Solutions:**
- App auto-downsizes to 800px width
- Should take 2-10 seconds max
- If > 15 seconds, try smaller image

### Issue: Camera won't open on mobile
**Possible causes:**
- Not using HTTPS (Vercel provides this)
- Browser permissions denied
- Unsupported browser

**Solutions:**
- Use HTTPS URL (Vercel deployment)
- Check browser settings → site permissions
- Try different browser (Chrome/Safari)
- Use "Upload Photo" as fallback

## ✅ Success Criteria for Phase 2

Phase 2 is successful if:

- [x] Builds without errors ✅
- [ ] Detects at least 50% of balls in good conditions
- [ ] Color classification better than random (>25% for pool, >14% for snooker)
- [ ] Completes processing in < 10 seconds
- [ ] Works on desktop with image upload ✅
- [ ] Works on mobile with camera (test Thursday)
- [ ] UI is responsive and looks good
- [ ] No crashes or freezes

**Don't expect perfection!** This is an MVP. The goal is:
1. Prove the concept works
2. Identify what needs improvement
3. Have something to show in portfolio

## 📊 What to Note During Testing

Create a simple test log:

```
TEST LOG - Phase 2

Image 1: pool-easy.jpg
- Balls visible: 5
- Balls detected: 4
- Correct types: 3
- Processing time: 3.2s
- Notes: Good detection, missed one in shadow

Image 2: pool-full.jpg
- Balls visible: 16
- Balls detected: 12
- Correct types: 8
- Processing time: 5.8s
- Notes: Struggled with clustered balls

Mobile Test 1: iPhone 13, Pool Hall

This helps you:
- Track what works
- Know what to improve in Phase 3
- Have data for your portfolio writeup

## 🎯 Quick Test Checklist

**Before Thursday:**
- [ ] Run locally: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Test with 2-3 downloaded images
- [ ] Verify detection completes
- [ ] Check detection summary looks good
- [ ] Fix any obvious bugs
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel
- [ ] Test Vercel URL on phone at home

**Thursday Evening:**
- [ ] Open Vercel URL at pool hall
- [ ] Test camera on 3-5 different table positions
- [ ] Note what works vs what doesn't
- [ ] Take screenshots of results
- [ ] Be proud - you built an AI app! 🎉

## 🚀 After Testing

Based on results, you can:

1. **Tweak detection parameters** in `ballDetector.ts`:
   - `minRadius` / `maxRadius` - adjust ball size range
   - `step` - detection grid density (smaller = slower but more accurate)
   - Edge threshold values

2. **Adjust color ranges** in `colorRanges.ts`:
   - Expand HSV ranges for colors that fail
   - Tighten ranges for false positives

3. **Improve preprocessing**:
   - Adjust blur radius
   - Change edge detection sensitivity

But for Thursday: **Just test and document what happens!**

Phase 3 will add shot recommendations. For now, proving detection works is the goal.

## 💡 Demo Tips

When showing to others:

1. **Start with a good image** - Use one you know works
2. **Explain the tech** - "HSV color space, circle detection, confidence scoring"
3. **Show the process** - Point out the progress indicators
4. **Highlight the results** - "Detected X balls with Y% confidence"
5. **Acknowledge limitations** - "MVP, will improve in Phase 3"
6. **Show mobile works** - Open camera, take live photo

**Portfolio talking points:**
- "Built custom computer vision without ML frameworks"
- "Mobile-first design, works in real pool halls"
- "Canvas-based processing, optimized for performance"
- "HSV color space for lighting tolerance"
- "End-to-end TypeScript, fully typed"
